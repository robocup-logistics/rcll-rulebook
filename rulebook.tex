\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The future of industrial production lies with smarter
systems. Manufacturing industries are on the brink of widely accepting
a new paradigm for organizing production by introducing perceiving,
active, context-aware, and autonomous systems. This is often referred
to as Industry~4.0~\cite{Industry-4.0}, a move from static process
chains towards more automation and autonomy. The corner stones for
this paradigm shift are \emph{smart factories}, which is a
context-aware facility in which manufacturing steps are considered as
services that can be combined efficiently in (almost) arbitrary ways
allowing for the production of various product types and variants
cost-effectively even in small lot sizes, rather than the more
traditional chains which produce only a small number of product types
at high volumes~\cite{RCLL-CPS}. Such factories will require a much
more capable logistics system, of which the most flexible form are
autonomous mobile robots.

The RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL) is determined to develop into a
state-of-the-art platform for mobile robotics education and research
tackling this problem of flexible and efficient production logistics at a
comprehensible size. This industrial motivated league keeps the focus
on challenges promoting precise actions and robust long-enduring
execution, and further encourages external data supported
autonomy. By providing feedback and competition hardware, Industrial
partner Festo provides insights into future factory concepts to help
 uncover relevant future topics for education and research.

 This year's competition is laid out in the pages to come.  It ensures
 the same and fair circumstances for all participants. It neither
 dictates nor suggests the way how to fulfill the task, but is meant
 to develop the RCLL further. Smart Factory environments require new
 concepts of flexibility, awareness and optimization from autonomous
 entities working in an environment with specified, yet to some degree
 uncertain and dynamic, agency. This includes current challenges of
 developing industry-wide standards for Cyber Physical Systems for
 production processes like designing plug-and-produce capable
 systems. Opposed to numerous approaches regarding production
 infrastructure, RCLL aims to provide concepts for smart production
 logistics.
 	
After an exciting RoboCup in Nagoya, we look forward to a new scale of
competition that will emerge from initiatives around the globe. In
2012 we had our first Logistics League World Champion.  In 2013 we
introduced the Referee Box (refbox) changing the competition at its
core by introducing a flow of information. This allowed for more
dynamic games and the automatic tracking of scores, and to relax the
hitherto existing regulations regarding additional computing power. In
2014 we merged the formerly separate playing fields into a single one,
on which both teams compete at the same time, introducing the need for
self-localization, collision avoidance, and increased spatial
coordination complexity. Additionally, the production schedules became
more dynamic in that orders were posted dynamically and less
frequently and there were times with no orders. In 2015 we introduced
actual physical processing machines based on the Festo Modular
Production System (MPS) requiring more complex machine
handling~\cite{wdrl2013}. Additionally, the production schedule has
again become more flexible and dynamic, by introducing color-coded
rings of which a varying number can be requested to be mounted in a
specific order for a certain product. This increased the number of
products from 3 to about 240. After three years of constant and
tremendous changes, 2016 was a year to consolidate our league as a
whole by increasing the number of participating teams and allowing
existing teams to excel in their capabilities. 2017 we changed
the field size and zone layout. Production had the main focus and
the exploration phase became shorter and less important.
Due the maximum points were still a long way off for each team and
the production phase still offers many more challenges, the year
2018 will also be a year of consolidation.
Furthermore, the TC is working towards the introduction of a
barcode recognition to track products and a new storage station.
This is a long-term effort. This year, the station
will provide pre-assembled products that can be bought for delivery.
In the following years, we will explore ways to extend this.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The Task}
\label{sec:task}

Our aim is to provide a simplified Smart Factory environment. The
teams must complete the following task without human interference,
competing with a second team against the clock. In the RCLL,
autonomous robot agents have to handle the logistics of materials
through several (dynamic) stages to produce final goods to fulfill
orders. The machines are specific MPS stations.

The Logistics League's main challenge is a multistage production cycle
of different product variants with self-crafted intermediate products
and delivery of final products. This genuine goal will be rewarded
considerably higher than partial fulfillment of the task. Autonomous
robots transport small products between the processing
machines. Machines are MPS stations which complete a particular
refinement step like mounting a colored ring or top-most cap. If
procurable this will lead to a new sub-assembly or final product
(cap). Complete work orders require all related sub-assemblies of
product variants (cf. \refsec{sec:production-complexities}).

This work flow is controlled by a referee box broadcasting information
via wifi (see \refsec{sec:referee-box}). The work flow itself is
divided into three different phases: a setup
phase (see \refsec{sec:setup-phase}), an exploration phase (see
\refsec{sec:exploration-phase}) during which robots receive scores for
correctly discovering and publishing the positions of the yet
unknown different machines on the field. After this phase the referee
box will announce all machine types and designations. In the following
production phase (see~\refsec{sec:production-phase}) orders are
announced by the referee box, which the robots must fulfill
automatically.

Finally,
successfully assembled products are to be delivered to the correct
conveyor belt of the team's delivery station. The factory
area has to be treated in the best possible way. Any possible damage
to the field, opposing robots or the machines will be penalized by the
referee.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Agreements \& Regulations}
\label{sec:agreements}
In the RCLL, all teams are obliged to use the Robotino robotic system
from Festo Didactic SE with certain freedoms and limitations. This
includes the current version, Robotino 3, as well as the phased-out
Robotino 2. \refsec{sec:robotino} describes the specific constraints.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Rules Philosophy}
\label{sec:rules-philosphy}
The goal of this industrially inspired league is to complete the tasks
as quickly and reliably as possible. Each team should act within the
meaning of a cooperative and fair behavior, even if everyone wants to
be the better one. Teams should not search for gaps or inconsistencies
in the rulebook to achieve advantages in the competition. Instead, we
ask explicitly to bring such gaps to our attention. Since the rulebook
cannot cover all possible cases, we consider a general gentleman
agreement: ``One should treat others as one would like others to treat
oneself''.

The general development of the rules loosely follows a tick-tock
rhythm, where years of larger rule modifications are followed by a
year of stabilization and conservative changes.

\section{Competition Area} \label{sec:area}
\subsection{Field Layout and Dimensions}
\label{sec:competition-area}
\begin{figure}[p]
    \includegraphics[width=\paperwidth, angle=-90 , trim = 0 0 0 0,]{field2017.pdf}
    \vspace{1ex}
    \caption{Competition area: squares indicate zones for possible
      machine placements, circles denote robots. Cyan and magenta are
      team assignment colors. Thick blue lines are wall elements. The
      green robot is at an acceptable position, while the red one
      would have to be penalized for leaving the field. Grey areas are
      insertion areas where robots start. No machines may be placed in
      the light-red areas.}
    \label{fig:competition-area}
\end{figure}
The competition area is shown in \reffig{fig:competition-area} and
features a \SI{14 x 8}{\metre} large arena with 106 square zones
of \SI{1 x 1}{\metre} with 14 randomly distributed machines. The
field is partially surrounded (at least 50\% but not more than 70\%)
by wall elements of at least \SI{0.5}{\metre} height.  The origin and
coordinate system of the competition field is drawn in
\reffig{fig:competition-area} and will be intrinsically referred to
for each statement within this rulebook. The normal floor of the
exposition-rooms is used, it will be reasonable flat. The entire area
is shared among both teams on the field and any robot may travel
anywhere at any time (while not obstructing for an extended period of
time or pushing other robots or machines). However, there are primary
sides (split along the y-axis) for each team where a team's
\textit{robot insertion area}, and \textit{Base, Storage and Delivery
  Stations}, are located. We will refer to the side with positive
coordinates on the x-axis as the (primary) half of team cyan, and the
side with negative coordinates on the x-axis as the primary half of
team magenta.

The robot insertion areas (gray area on \reffig{fig:competition-area})
are outside of the main game area. All 14 machines, 7 per team, are
placed within the factory area as stated in
\reffig{fig:competition-area}. Machines have two kind of sides: active
(wide, where the robot interacts) and ignored (narrow) edges.  The
constraints for positioning of the MPS are given in
\refsec{sec:machine-swapping}.

The distribution and alignment of all machines is axially symmetrical
to the y-axis. Thus, each team has similar conditions on both halves of
the competition field. Both teams have an exclusive set of 7 out of
the 14 machines each. Machines from one team can also be located on the
primary side of the opposing team. We will later discuss the concept
of the production machine distribution for each team in detail.

The center coordinates and the size of the zones in which the machines
are placed can be seen in \reffig{fig:competition-area}. The zone
names are structured as a team prefix (``C-'' for cyan, ``M-'' for
magenta), Z to distinguish zone names, and a grid coordinate. For
example, The zone C-Z23 is the zone on the cyan primary half, which is
the second along the X-axis and the third along the Y-axis. Zones are
only a means to position machines. They will not be physically
represented or visible on the field. They cannot be used for any other
purpose.

Note that this specific field layout is an example only, accounting
for symmetry and avoiding clustering of machine access nodes and
unapproachable machines. However, the actual distribution and
alignment of machines on the competition area will change before the
actual game starts and will be different for each game. Thus, teams
should focus on a generic approach for production, allowing for
dynamic adaptation of machine positions and alignments.

\subsubsection{Moving on the Field}
\label{sec:field-movement}
The robots are free to move on the field. However, robots may not
leave the main area (surrounded by the partial walls). That is, when
connecting all wall segments with the shortest possible edges, robots
may not move such that the base is fully outside this area. For
example, in \reffig{fig:competition-area}, the red robot is outside
the intended area and thus in an illegal position.

Robots that leave the competition area illegally are considered as
\emph{misbehaving robot} and punished accordingly
(cf.~\refsec{sec:robot-maintenance}).

\subsection{Machines}
\label{sec:machines}
Machines are based on the Modular Production System (MPS)\footnote{For
  more information see
  \url{http://www.robocup-logistics.org/links/festo-mps}.} by Festo
Didactic SE. The MPS provides a number of stations which
make up the machines used in the competition. The stations have a
rectangular base shape of \SI{0,35 x 0,7}{\metre} with a height of
about \SI{1}{\metre} depending on machine type. The machine
has individual application modules that provide different
functionality.

All machines share the same basic layout: a trolley, conveyor belt,
and signal light. A machine is movable by four wheels with
\SI{0.1}{\metre} clearance. Both narrow sides of the trolley are
closed by plexiglas and have a handle. All physical interfaces like
conveyor belt inputs and outputs, shelves, and slides for additional
bases on ring stations are accessible at \SI{89.8}{\centi\metre}
height.\footnote{Note however, that due to small variances and
  unevenness in the floor there may likewise be small variances in the
  working height of some or all parts of a station.} Working space
between guiding lanes is \SI{4.5}{\centi\metre}. Setup lanes and
shelves feature approximately the same space for handling and
adjusting. All diffuse sensors (input side) have been removed to allow for infrared-emitting cameras.
To simplify the delivery on the belt, each machine will be
equipped with a narrowing cone on its input side (\reffig{fig:narrow-cone}).
You can order them from Festo Didactic SE (C. Deppe)
or download the STL model file from the RCLL site.
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[height=8cm]{narrowConeSketch.jpg}
\caption{Narrowing cone}
\label{fig:narrow-cone}
\end{figure}
% Still unclear, thus commenting out.
% If observed from the output side of machines (where the signal unit
% is placed) the conveyor space opens up at half of the aluminum
% profile thus starting at \SI{0,35}{\metre}.

%    \includegraphics[height=7cm]{MPS2015/MPS_Layout.jpg}
%
%    \caption{General Machine Layout}
%    \label{fig:MPS-Layout}
%\end{figure}
Based on these shared properties, there are five kinds of machines:

\begin{description}
\item[Base Station (BS)] acts as dispenser of base elements
  (\reffig{fig:BS}). The application modules are three magazines of
  base elements. There is a single BS per team.

\item[Cap Station (CS)] mounts a cap as the final step in production
  on an intermediate product (\reffig{fig:CS}). The application module
  is a vacuum pick \& place module. There is a slide to store at most
  one cap piece at a time. At the beginning this slide is empty and
  has to be filled in the following way.  A base element with a cap
  must be taken to the machine and is then unmounted and buffered in
  the slide. The cap is then mounted on the next intermediate product
  taken to the machine. There are two CS per team.

\item[Ring Station (RS)] mounts one colored ring out of two available
  colors on an intermediate product (\reffig{fig:RS}). Each RS has two
  vacuum pick \& place units as application modules with separate
  unique colors which are determined new for each game. There is an
  additional pre-fill slide which is used for some colors (specified
  anew for each game) to add base elements. There are two RS per team.

\item[Storage Station (SS)] provides 24 slots of storage divided into
  6 layers (\reffig{fig:SS_portrait}). For now items can be  shipped out on the output side on
  request. The Storage Station provides a sample of each possible
  $C_0$ configuration (one per layer).\footnote{Note that this is the
    specific content for 2018 and may change in the future.}

\item[Delivery Station (DS)] Accepts completed products. The stations
  contains three slides (\reffig{fig:DS}). The robot has to prepare
  the proper one for a specific order
  (cf. \refsec{sec:production-machines-production}). The delivered
  products are verified by either the referees or an automated
  external vision system. There is one DS per team.
\end{description}

\noindent
Machines of type CS and RS are called production machines as they
perform refinement steps on a workpiece during the production
phase. Processing times are outlined in \reftab{tab:processing-times}.

  \caption{Machine tags are ALVAR tags with the given IDs.}
  \label{tab:markers}
\end{table}
Each machine will feature two \emph{markers} based on ALVAR AR tags,
one will be placed on the input, another one on the output side. All
markers used are depicted in \reftab{tab:markers}. The marker will be
horizontally centered below the conveyor belt. The vertical distance
(between tag and conveyor belt) will be about
\SI{35}{\centi\metre}. The markers will be mounted at the same
position on all machines in a best effort fashion. But teams should
expect to calibrate individually per marker. They are available for
printing on the RoboCup Logistics website.


\subsubsection{Machine Positioning}
\label{sec:machine-swapping}
The zones and rotations for the MPS will be randomly chosen by the RefBox.
Each game will have a new randomly generated field layout, the referees will place the MPS in the middle of the zone with given rotation at there best effort but errors of the positioning should be expected.

  \caption{MPS orientation mapping during mirroring}
  \label{tab:mirror-a}
\end{wrapfigure}
A MPS can be placed in any zones except C-Z52 and M-Z52. These zones
are needed to enter the field.  Each MPS has one out of 8 possible
orientations, starting at \ang{0} with steps of \ang{45}. To denote
the orientation, we assign a local right-handed coordinate system to
each MPS station. The x-axis is given by the conveyor pointing from
the output to the input. The origin is the center point of the
conveyor. The orientation is then the relative rotation of the local
MPS system compared to the fixed field coordinate system. For example,
at an MPS orientation of \ang{0}, its local coordinate system is
aligned with the field (in terms of orientation). Furthermore, an MPS
at an orientation of \ang{90} will be rotated counter-clockwise a
quarter turn compared to the field system.

To ensure fairness, positions and orientations of the machines are
mirrored along the field's y-axis. There are two cases that need to be
handled separately. First, machines in a cell not adjacent to the
wall, and machines of types BS, DS, and SS (even when adjacent to the wall) are mirrored according to
\reftab{tab:mirror-a}. Second, CS and RS stations must be handled
slightly different, if oriented next to a wall (zones: C-Z*1, C-Z*8,
C-Z7*, M-Z*1, M-Z*8 and M-Z7*). The reason being, that the shelf and
slide of these stations are offset sideways at the input side. This
might lead to the situation that for one team the shelf is close to
the wall, and for the other it is not. To remedy this problem, the RS
and CS machines adjacent to a wall will always be placed such that the
shelf or slide is on the farther end with respect to the wall. For
example, in \reffig{fig:competition-area}, the magenta CS in M-Z76
with a rotation of \ang{270}. Were this setup mirrored, the shelf on the cyan CS in
C-Z76 would be close to the wall. Instead, it has a different
orientation violating the y-symmetry but allowing for easier access to
the shelf.

\begin{figure}[t!]

    \caption{Blocked zones regarding the MPS rotation (red zones must

    \label{fig:zone-mps-blocked}
\end{figure}
For placing of machines, the RefBox will take care of the necessary
constraints to ensure that all in- and output sides, shelves and
slides are reachable.  If a machine is rotated with \ang{0}, \ang{90},
\ang{180} or \ang{270} the zones in front the input and output side
are blocked as well (\reffig{fig:zone-mps-rotation-straight}).  For
machines with rotations \ang{45}, \ang{135}, \ang{225} and \ang{315}
three zones in front of each input and output side are blocked
(\reffig{fig:zone-mps-rotation-odd}). No MPS nor blocked zones for another MPS may be placed in a
blocked zone. All blocked zones of any MPS must be located within the
competition area. Furthermore, only two machines will ever be placed
next to each other, a third machine will only be placed with at least
one empty zone in-between.

The MPS will be placed mostly on the primary half of a team
(cf. \refsec{sec:competition-area}). However, some machines will be
swapped, that is, some machines will not be located in the primary
half.

For each game, one CS and one RS of each team will be chosen randomly
and swapped with the corresponding machine of the other team on the
non-primary half -- that is two machines in total per team. The CS and
RS will be swapped with the symmetrically positioned machine of the
same type of the other team. For consecutive games, the changes to the
machine to zone assignment may be limited by the referee box in order
to reduce the time needed to implement the layout during the setup
phase.

\subsubsection{MPS -- During Exploration Phase}
\label{sec:production-machines-exp}
During the exploration phase the robots of each team must explore the
unknown factory environment to identify where the different MPS are
located and in which rotations they are positioned.

The Referee Box assigns each machine to a team and a zone
(\reffig{fig:competition-area}) at the start of the exploration
phase,\footnote{Since 2017 there are no more fixed stations.}
The zones and orientations (in steps of 45$^\circ$) are randomly determined,  and will not be
communicated until the production phase. For details about the
Exploration Phase confer~\refsec{sec:exploration-phase}.

The signal light of the MPS will show a yellow light until a report regarding this machine is sent.
If the wrong MPS zone is sent, the light will start red flashing.
If only the MPS zone is sent, the green light will be turn on.
If the zone and rotation is correctly reported, the green light will be flashing and if the zone is correct but the rotation wrongly reported the red and green light will be on.

\vspace*{-2mm}
\subsubsection{MPS -- During Production Phase}
\label{sec:production-machines-production}
In the production phase a production machine performs refinement steps on
a product such as mounting an additional ring or a cap. Machines
operate in a transaction style. That is, before using a machine it
must be prepared for a specific mode. Then the input products can be fed
into the machine and the refinement step commences. Eventually, after
the production period is completed, the resulting product is delivered
on the output lane.

A light signal mounted near the output lane
(cf. \refsec{sec:machines}) indicates the state of the machine. In the
default operating mode, the green light is turned on. This signals
that the machine is ready for preparation. When preparation is performed,
the machine will flash the green light for up to 3 seconds (it
immediately switches to a new state, e.g., if a product is fed into the
machine before the three seconds have expired). When a product is fed
to the input, the signal light indicates the processing condition. If
the machine accepts the input and starts processing, the green and yellow lights
will be turned on steadily for as long as the processing is
performed. Once processing completes, the signal light switches to a
steady yellow light. If a product is fed for which additional bases
were required but which have not been delivered, the machine will
flash the red and yellow light and will be out of order
(cf. \refsec{sec:broken-machine}). The light signals are summarized in
\reftab{tab:production-machines-feedback}.

In the production phase, machines must be prepared to be used. This
applies to all machine types.  The DS, CS and RS start the conveyor
belt upon receiving a prepare message. If no workpiece reaches the
machine operating point (indicated through the middle belt sensor)
within \SI{30}{\second}, the machine goes to a temporary out-of-order
state (cf.~\refsec{sec:broken-machine}). The BS and SS will
immediately dispense a workpiece upon receiving a prepare message. The
workpiece may remain on the machine for an arbitrary time.

The following describes the communication and reactions of the
machines during the production phase. For the actual messages we refer
to the integrator's manual~\cite{RefBoxIntManual}.

\smallskip

\noindent\textbf{BS}
The BS prepare message denotes the color of the base element that should
be dispensed. After receiving the message, the refbox will instruct
the MPS to immediately provide a base of the desired color.

\noindent\textbf{DS}
The DS prepare message denotes the slide the product should be delivered
to. The DS will consume any workpiece provided, but points can only be
scored if the DS was properly prepared before (means the corresponding
delivery lane which was desired in the refbox order).

\noindent\textbf{CS}
The CS prepare message initiates either the retrieval or the mounting of
a cap. For retrieving a prepared base (with a cap mounted on top) from
the machine's shelf must be fed into the machine. All base elements
prepared on the shelf are specially colored workpieces (clear). The
machine will take the cap off the base and buffer it on the slide,
releasing the decapped base to the output side. This base can only be
used for providing an additional base to an RS (see below), reuse by
placing it back on the shelf, or discarding it at the DS.  For
mounting a cap, a workpiece (without cap) must be provided onto which
the cap is mounted.

\noindent\textbf{RS}
The RS prepare message must state which of the two colors to prepare and
retrieve. Each RS is responsible for two specific colors. Some colors
require loading the RS with additional bases
(cf.~\refsec{sec:production-plan}). If the desired color requires
additional bases (cf.~\refsec{sec:production-complexities}), the
machine expects to receive them first. Once the required number of
additional bases has been received, the intermediate product can be
fed into the machine. It receives a ring of the desired color and
moves the processed product to the output.

\noindent\textbf{SS}\footnote{The TC is working towards the
  integration of the SS for 2018. Issues arising or the lack of
  development resources might lead to exclusion of the SS from the
  tournament on short notice.}
%
The SS prepare message denotes the storage place where to store the
next input workpiece, or from which place to retrieve an item
from. There will be designated positions for specific $C_0$ workpieces
which will be announced at the beginning of the
tournament.\footnote{Please note again, this is an assignment
  specifically for 2018 and may change in future competitions.} If a
position is requested for which no product has been stored (or has
already been retrieved), the machine will be broken
(cf.~\refsec{sec:broken-machine}). The products retrieved from the SS
are only allowed for some specific order,
cf.~\refsec{sec:production-plan}. Note the costs for retrieving a base
outlined in \refsec{sec:production-scoring}.

\medskip
The preparation and use of a machine follows a transaction style. Once the
machine has been prepared, the full cycle can be completed (committed).
There may be only one transaction running at a time. If a
second preparation is performed the machine will
be temporarily broken (cf.~\refsec{sec:broken-machine}).

An MPS may be reset by a team at any time by a dedicated msg (see
referee box Integrator's Manual~\cite{RefBoxIntManual}). This causes
the MPS to go into the broken state
(cf.~\refsec{sec:broken-machine}). It allows teams to recover machines
after handling errors (which the robots must recognize themselves).

\subsection{Products and Workpieces}
\label{sec:products}
Workpieces denote raw material and intermediate stages during
production. These are also named products with emphasis on the
finished product that can be delivered. For product complexities refer
to \refsec{sec:production-complexities}, for the compilation of the
production plan to \refsec{sec:production-plan}.

  \label{fig:workpieces}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The workpieces consist of the following elements:
\begin{description}
\item[Base] The base is the lowermost element in each production.
  Bases are dispensed by the base station (BS) and bases with mounted
  caps are available on the cap stations (CS). Bases are available in
  the colors red, black, silver, and transparent. Transparent bases
  are to be used and only used on CS shelves
  (cf.~\refsec{sec:production-machines-production}), they cannot be
  used as a workpiece for production. They may, however, be used to
  provide additional bases required by an RS, stored on a team's CS
  shelf, or recycled at the DS.
\item[Ring] Rings are mounted in intermediate production steps at ring
  stations (RS). A product requires, zero, one, two, or three
  intermediate rings of distinct color
  (cf.~\refsec{sec:production-complexities}). The order of the rings
  matters. The ring colors are blue, green, yellow, and orange.
\item[Cap] Caps are the topmost element in each production. They are
  obtained by taking pre-assembled base-cap combinations available on
  the shelf to the cap station (CS). Caps can be black or gray.

\end{description}
Only one workpiece or a composite product must be grasped and
transported per robot at once. Storage magazines on the robot or
similar are prohibited. All products will incorporate exactly one base
unit allowing a single unified handling device to be used for all
operations involving workpieces.

  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/barcode-base}
  \caption{Prototype base barcode.}
  \label{fig:barcode}
\end{wrapfigure}
\paragraph{Barcodes.}
All bases are labeled by a horizontally revolving, white glossy tag
covering about 50 percent of the bases height (from the center)
containing a white reference area as well as an identifying
barcode. Each base is equipped with a unique ID. \reffig{fig:barcode}
shows a prototype of a barcode labeled workpiece.

The barcodes are scanned at each station and communicated to the
referee box. The referee box uses the barcodes to track assembly
processes, i.e., to determine the state of a workpiece. This allows in
particular to award points for production steps as they happen
(cf. \refsec{sec:production-scoring}).

\section{Referees}
Referees manage the overall game, make sure that the rules of the game
are followed, and instruct and monitor the referee box.

\subsection{Referee Delegation}
Each participating team of the tournament must provide at least two
team members which act as referees. These referees must be announced
at the beginning of the tournament and are fixed throughout the whole
competition (unless the participant drops out of the tournament,
e.g., because of illness). The referees must meet the following
criteria. They must

\begin{itemize}
\item be available for each game that they are assigned to and appear
  5 minutes prior to the game start time (schedule to be announced by
  Organizing Committee at beginning of the tournament)
\item have good knowledge of the rulebook and the applied rules
\item participate in the referee briefings (organized by Organization
  and Technical Committees)
\item be able to lead a game and communicate with the teams in
  English.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tasks and Responsibilities}
Each game requires 3 referees. One referee will run and oversee the
referee box. Two field referees observe the field, announce rule
violations, and communicate with the teams and refbox referee. Each
field referee is assigned to a particular field half. The referee
named first on the schedule is the head referee and is responsible for the
team cyan and their corresponding field half. The head referee has
the upper hand when there is a referee disagreement and then announces
the final decision. The second listed referee assumes the liability of the
team magenta.

The refbox referee has to operate the control machine during the game,
observe its status to ensure the correctness of the digital
representation and automatic scoring, announce critical situations to
the field referees, and start and stop the game on request of the
field referees. The refbox referee must also enter robot restarts and
observe the time remaining to bring back a robot, or announce if a
robot may no longer participate in the game (second restart).

The field referees observe the game from the side of the field or from
any position on the field (e.g., to better understand the game
situation). They shall avoid robots spatially on the field, but
ultimately robots are expected to avoid collision with human
referees. Field referees are also responsible for removing fallen
products from the playing-ground. Field referees are responsible for
making the decision whether a team may take out a robot for
maintenance. And they observe the correct refill procedure of their
field half.

Each referee may call a pause of the game at any time, e.g., if robots
must be penalized or disentangled after a collision. Referees may
explicitly pause the game to convene and discuss an unclear situation
as to avoid hasty decisions. Such pauses shall be short-lived as to
follow the competition schedule.

\subsection{Liability Waiver}
Referees cannot be held liable for:
\begin{itemize}
\item any kind of injury suffered by a player, official or spectator
\item any damage to property of any kind
\item any other loss suffered by any individual, club, company,
  association or other body, which is due or which may be due to any
  decision, which he may take under the terms of the rules of the game
  or in respect of the normal procedures required to hold, play and
  control a match.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Complaint Procedure}
Rule issues are not to be discussed during a game. Referee decisions
are binding for the game. A team may protest and challenge a game by
executing the following complaint procedure. The procedure is also
automatically invoked if a referee decides to abort a game for any
reason (e.g., field damage, lighting failures, burning robots).

To initiate the complaint procedure, the team leader of the
challenging team is to contact a member of the Technical Committee
within 10 minutes after the respective game has ended. The member of
the Technical Committee then invokes a team leader conference in
cooperation with the Organizing Committee. In this conference, the
following parties participate: the referees of the game in question,
not less than half of all registered team leaders, and the Technical
Committee (counseling). The situation shall be resolved by unanimous
consent or by vote of the team leaders (majority of team leaders
participating in the conference is sufficient).

All teams are reminded that while this is a competition, the league is
also about \emph{cooperative} research and evaluation and complaints
should be handled in a fair and forthcoming way.

\section{Game Play}
A match is defined by two contesting teams competing within the same
identical competition area. Each team consists of a maximum of 3
robots. Each has three phases -- for setup, exploration, and
production -- which are detailed below.

\subsection{Environment Setup}
\label{sec:env-setup}
The physical distribution and alignment of the production machines is
dynamic. The field will be organized as described in
\refsec{sec:competition-area}. The referee box will determine the
assignment of the machines to the zones at the beginning of a game
randomly (\refsec{sec:machine-swapping}).
The color for ring stations will be
randomized prior to each match. The processing time of each production
step (i.e., per ring color and per cap mounting machine) will be
determined in the same way. The target delivery slide will be
randomized per order. During the setup phase
(cf.~\refsec{sec:setup-phase}) each team has the responsibility to
fill the input magazines on their base station. The elements may only
be touched by a robot or by designated persons after the game has
started.

% The robots can be set up within the factory area and have not been
% elevated into their autonomous state. Any necessary setup routine can
% be performed. This includes, but is not limited to, remote start-up of
% programs, localization procedures, or vision calibration.

\subsection{Interruptions and Robot Maintenance}
\label{sec:robot-maintenance}
During a match and while the robot is active on the field no manual
interference or manipulation of the robot in hardware, software,
configuration, instructions, or whatsoever, is allowed.  Teams may
visualize robot data on computers at the field, but existing keyboards
must be covered with a sheet of paper in order to assert a fair game
without manual interference.

% In the case of a misbehaving or broken robot, a team can ask the
% referee to take out a robot. Note, however, that one robot interfering
% with another is no conduct of misbehavior (unless damage is to be
% expected) and no reason to call out a robot. Similarly, to ask to take
% out a robot which is in a software deadlock situation of the own
% control software is not judged as a broken robot. The final decision
% whether a robot can be taken out or not remains with the field
% referee. The referee acts upon this motion at a time of his choosing,
% but as soon as possible.

Each team is allowed to maintain each robot once per game. The team
has to call upon the referee for \textit{robot maintenance}.  The
referee should judge the game situation carefully and should allow the
robot to be taken out for maintenance, if the calling team would have
any advantage in the current game situation from taking out the
robot. An advantage would be, for instance, to take out a robot, if
two robots of the same team are hindering each other. It is up to the
discretion of the referee when to allow the robot maintenance.

Another reason for maintenance is a \emph{misbehaving robot}. Several
infringements in this rulebook demand that the robot be taken out,
e.g., leaving the field (cf.~\refsec{sec:field-movement}).

Because the new generation of Robotinos is relatively heavy and bulky,
up to two team members are allowed to remove a robot from the field.
Or the robots may be driven out manually by remote control using a
joystick, gamepad or similar. Human commands must be mapped directly
to motion commands, no autonomous driving is allowed. In both cases
(driving out and taking out) the robot must leave the field through
the closest opening in the wall unless this would interfere with the
game. In that case, the next closest exit may be chosen (referee
decides). The robot need to be carried to the insertion area
for re-participation.

The repair time may take at most 120 seconds, starting from the moment
of driving or taking out the robot.  After a robot has been taken out
for the first time, the team can perform any repairs to the robot
and/or the robot's software. To return the robot into the game, the
team asks the referee to place back the robot onto the field. After
the referee accepts the motion, the team has 15 seconds quick setup
time, which is limited to basic instructions like initial localization
or software start-up. The robot may leave the insertion area onto the
field (autonomous driving). If the robot is not returned to the field
in time, it is disqualified from the ongoing game.

The referee can interrupt the game at any point in time, but should do
so rarely as not to interfere with the overall game flow (also
cf.~\refsec{sec:during-match}).

If a robot needs to be taken out for the second time, either on
request or as decided by the referee, it is disqualified from the
current game. It may no longer communicate with the still active
robots and must be taken out of the competition area.


\subsection{Game Start}
\label{sec:game-start}
%
All matches will start at the exact time scheduled by the Organizing
Committee with the setup phase (cf.~\refsec{sec:setup-phase}). Once
the exploration phase starts, no more interference with the robot is
allowed. The robot must react to the referee box game state messages
to start the game play autonomously.

\subsection{Setup Phase}
\label{sec:setup-phase}
No team member is allowed to enter the competition area prior to or
during a match, except in cases of robot maintenance
(cf.~\refsec{sec:robot-maintenance}) or machine refill
(cf.~\refsec{sec:machine-refill}).  All robots which are to
participate in the game need to be in the insertion area during setup
(not in the game area where the machines are located). The referee box
will control the setup period and automatically switch to the
exploration phase after 5 minutes.

\subsection{Exploration Phase}
\label{sec:exploration-phase}
The robots have \SI{3}{\minute} to roam the environment and report
their 7 MPS to the referee box. The report about an MPS may be split
in two parts, the position and type of a machine, and its orientation.
Concretely, the referee box expects a \emph{machine identification
  message} with a tuple consisting of zone, machine name (as encoded
in the markers), orientation in degrees. This message bay be partially
filled to account for the two parts. Please consult the referee box
Integrator's Manual~\cite{RefBoxIntManual} for a detailed definition
of the message types. Reports are only accepted for MPS of the
respective team over the private encrypted team channel. Only the
first information for each MPS is processed and then never
updated. The scoring is shown in \reftab{tab:scoring-exploration}. A
minimum of zero points will be accounted for the exploration
phase. The exploration phase ends either after the time has passed or
immediately after both teams have each reported their respective set
of MPS.

Moving or processing workpieces at an MPS is not allowed during the
exploration phase.

\subsection{Production Phase}
\label{sec:production-phase}
With the end of the exploration phase the production phase begins,
which lasts \SI{17}{\minute}. The referee box publishes information
regarding products and machines. This includes machine zones and
orientations, and contained colors of ring and cap stations
(cf.~\refsec{sec:products}). The refbox posts orders
(cf.~\refsec{sec:production-plan}) which then must be fulfilled by the
robot teams. Using production machines requires interaction through
communication with the refbox described in
\refsec{sec:production-machines-production}.

A minimum of zero points will be accounted for the production phase.

\subsubsection{Production, Color Complexities, and Additional Bases}
\label{sec:production-complexities}
The portfolio comprises many different product variants and is
categorized by the four available \emph{product complexity} levels
shown in \reffig{fig:production-complexities}. The lowest complexity
$C_0$ consists of just a base and a cap and requires to load the CS
with the proper cap color and then processing a properly colored base
at that machine. The highest complexity $C_3$ requires a base with
three mounted rings and a cap. For a product, the colors of base,
rings, and cap as well as the order of the rings are of importance.

Depending on the ring color, the robot may have to deliver one or more
\emph{additional bases} to a RS first in order to get a ring. We
therefore distinguish \emph{color complexities} as $CC_0$, $CC_1$, and
$CC_2$ depending on whether zero, one, or two additional bases are
required for a color. The referee box ensures that there will always
be some orders for $C_1$ products where the ring color does not
require additional bases, i.e., with color complexity $CC_0$ -- but
not necessarily all $C_1$ orders have this constraint.

\vspace{-1mm}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Production Plan}
\label{sec:production-plan}
The referee box will announce orders throughout the game in an
incremental fashion. Each order will consist of the product variant to
produce, the amount thereof, and a delivery time slot. An order
therefore specifies a production chain to be accomplished for
fulfillment. \reffig{fig:production-chains} shows some example
production chains of the four different complexities
(cf.~\refsec{sec:production-complexities}). The ring colors which
require additional bases are randomized per game and announced by the
refbox. There will be one color requiring 2 additional bases, one
requiring 1 base, and two colors requiring no additional base at
all. Products retrieved from the Storage Station may be used only for
$C_0$ orders with a requested quantity equal to or greater than two.

In each game, up to 10 orders will be placed.\footnote{There will up
  to 9 orders in regular game time, and an additional order in the
  case of overtime. The number can be adjusted during the tournament
  by the Technical Committee, should this turn out to be necessary.}
The complexities of orders will be similar for all games within a
tournament phase. But the actual production chains are
randomized. Each order will require one or more products of a
specified product type to be delivered. The product is specified in
terms of base color, rings (color and order), cap color, and possible
delivery gate. The delivery time slot will have a randomized start
time. The duration will be randomized between 30 to 180 seconds. The
end time shall be within the game time. There is not necessarily an
open order for a particular product at a specific time, or any order
at all. The first order will be posted within the first 120 seconds of
the game (but not necessarily at the beginning of the game). Orders
for the products of complexity $C_2$ or $C_3$ will not begin in the
first 300 seconds. An order will be announced before the delivery time
slots starts. For $C_0$ products the lead time ahead of the start of
the time window is 60 to 120 seconds, for $C_1$ it is 120 to 300
seconds, and for $C_2$ and $C_3$ orders the time is between 300 and
600 seconds. Two early orders will be posted that are announced in the
first third of the game with a delivery time window in the last
third. For each of the complexities $C_0$ and $C_1$ a standing order
for a single product will be placed at the beginning of the production
phase, which can be fulfilled at any time during the game.

Teams playing on the field at the same time will get the same
production plan. However, each game will use a new randomized order
schedule.

The multi-staged production processes can be repeated as long as
enough material can be provided to complete the cycle (also
cf.~\refsec{sec:machine-refill}). The different machine types are
specified in Section~\ref{sec:machines}.

\subsubsection{Machine Refill}
\label{sec:machine-refill}
The teams are responsible for restocking all materials (base elements,
rings, prepared caps on shelves, and $C_0$ in the SS) before and during matches. Each
team has to designate one team-member as a \textit{"replenisher"} who
must be specified to the corresponding "field half/team" referee ahead
of each game.  Only this team member will be allowed to access the
field area and only in case of a recent refill procedure.  The
replenisher must not obstruct other robots and should interfere as
little as possible.  The machines can only be refilled when a magazine
or shelf is empty. In this case the field-operator may enter the
competition-area without asking the referee. Shelves have to be
(re)filled in all three reachable slots. The replenisher may restock
only caps if transparent base elements have been put back to the
shelf, once no cap is remaining on this shelf.

The teams are partly free to choose their assembly and placement of
products.
For example, teams can fill any number of bases into a BS or are free to choose the color of caps for a CS,
however teams are only allowed to fill the CS if the whole shelf is empty and then it has to be filled completely.
The color assignment of bases on
the BS and SS must be obeyed, as otherwise they will deliver the wrong
bases.

\subsection{Special Events during a Match}
\label{sec:during-match}
Any referee can interrupt the match at any time. After the game is
paused, all robots have 3 seconds to stop any movement.  Robots that
do not stop within the time limit will be treated in the same way as
misbehaving robots (cf.~\refsec{sec:robot-maintenance}).  The match
time will be paused during the interruption.

\subsubsection{Scheduled Machine Downtime}
\label{sec:out-of-order}
The refbox will take down machines randomly out of the pool containing
the RS and CS. It will do so at random points of time and with the
same conditions for both teams, i.e., affecting the same machines for
both teams. There will be 2 of such triggered events during a
match. The machines affected will remain out of order for 30 to 60
seconds. Every machine can only be forced out of order once per
match. If a machine turns offline during processing a product it will
afterwards resume the process (extending the overall processing time
by the down time). The downtime is indicated by a steady red
light. Base elements fed into the machine while out-of-order are
accepted when the machine gets back online, with the same constraints
mentioned in \refsec{sec:production-machines-production}.

\subsubsection{Broken Machine Downtime}
\label{sec:broken-machine}
If a machine is improperly instructed or used, or a reset message has
been sent, the machine will go into a failure state. The machine cannot be
used for 30 seconds and until repaired. That is, if damage was
inflicted on the machine or the referee needs longer to repair the
machine the game continues and the machine will be offline for a
longer time. Any production that was running will be aborted and any
product which was being processed is no longer available and will be
removed by the referee. Any additional bases delivered to the machine
will be void and the points gained removed. For storage stations, no
slot is refilled, the load status remains exactly as before the broken
state. The downtime is indicated by a flashing red light.

\subsection{Task Fulfillment and Scoring}
\label{sec:production-scoring}
During the production phase, points are awarded for intermediate
production steps and final delivery of goods according to
\reftab{tab:scoring}.

Points for production steps are awarded as soon as
completed.\footnote{This relies on the bar code system described in
  \refsec{sec:products} which will be introduced in 2018. Should this
  be delayed or proof infeasible, the mode of operation in 2017 will
  be used: all points related to a product, including the points for
  finishing intermediate step like mounting the last ring on higher
  complexity products, are awarded on delivery only. Products, which
  are not delivered, do not score. That includes half-finished
  products at the end of the game in particular. Production points are
  also awarded for later deliveries, that is, points for steps like
  mounting the cap are awarded in full for as long as there was or is
  an order active for that specific product if there are still items
  in the order remaining, i.e., not the full amount of ordered products
  has been delivered.}
%
Points are only awarded if there is yet an order for which the
performed step is required and which has not yet expired (the end of
the order time window has not yet passed) and for which the step has
not been performed for as often as products have been requested. For
example, consider a $C_1$ order with a single ring of which two
products have been requested. When the appropriate ring of that $C_1$
product is mounted, the appropriate points (for finishing a $C_1$
pre-cap) are awarded if and only if the end time of the delivery
window of that order has not passed and the step has not been
completed more than two times (including the just performed
step). Therefore, only production steps which can be determined to
belong to an upcoming (and announced) or on-going order can be
awarded. Performing a step for a later order which has not yet been
announced cannot be awarded.

There is a special case regarding the Storage Station. Retrieving a
workpiece has a cost (see \reftab{tab:scoring}). The cost is
subtracted as soon as the workpiece is ready for retrieval on the SS.
However, exploration points gained during the exploration will not be
used for this. If the team has not yet received sufficient points,
workpieces can be ``purchased on (partial) credit''. Points that were
missing upon preparation will be subtracted later from points scored.

\end{table}

\subsection{Obstruction Penalty}
\label{sec:obstruction-penalty}

As the Logistics League follows the idea of having both active teams
compete alongside each other, instead of directly against each other, we
punish intentional obstruction of the opposing team.

This applies in particular to the input and output area in front of
any MPS.  All robots are allowed to enter this space, but robots must
not obstruct opposing robots which intend to approach their
MPS. Concretely, that robot must give way and release an approachable
path to the MPS within a time window of 10 seconds. If a robot cannot
follow this rule, a pushing foul will be called according to Section
\ref{sec:pushing-rules}.

% old ?!
Furthermore, teams are penalized for obstruction according to
\reftab{tab:scoring} when delivering a workpiece to a machine of the
opposing team.  In this case, the workpiece becomes junk and cannot be
used afterwards.

\subsection{Pushing Rules}
\label{sec:pushing-rules}

With multiple teams on the field at the same time, robots must
implement ways for collision avoidance. At the same time, they shall
not interfere with the goods of the other team. The case where a robot
of one team bumps into or moves a robot of another team we
call ``pushing''.

The following rules shall be obeyed by the robots and provide the
guidelines for referees to call for improper behavior of a robot due
to pushing.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pushing occurs only between robots of different teams.
\item Robots must drive such that they try to avoid physical contact
  with robots from the opposing team. However, physical contact per se
  does not represent an offense.
\item All robots should be equipped with appropriate sensors to detect
  situations of physical contact with other robots (direct pushing
  situations).
\item If physical contact with other robots cannot be avoided, it must
  be soft, i.e., at slow speed and with as small physical impact as
  possible, in order to avoid damage to itself and other
  robots. Robots moving at high speed must significantly decelerate
  before a collision occurs with another robot.
\item If a destruction collision is immediate and the robots do not
  react, the referee should use the refbox to send a stop command to
  all robots. Every team has to react to the stop command by
  immediately stopping their robots.
\item Whenever a robot produces direct physical contact with another
  robot while moving, it must stop movement immediately in that
  direction (and choose a new direction for movement).
\item If pushing occurs between a moving and a standing robot, the
  moving robot causes the pushing situation and is responsible for
  resolving it. If it is not able to do so, a pushing foul will be
  called.
\item If pushing occurs between two moving robots, both robots are
  responsible for resolving the pushing situation. If one robot
  continues pushing by moving in its initial direction, while the
  other robot is recognizably reacting and trying to take another
  direction, the foul will be called on the pushing robot.
\item If two robots encounter physical contact and cannot resolve the
  situation because they get entangled, the referee may issue a
  pushing foul on both robots.
\item If, in the opinion of the referee, physical contact between two
  robots is not soft, or if one or both of the robots do not change
  direction after encountering physical contact, a pushing foul will
  be called.
\item When a pushing foul is detected the responsible team has to use
  up their restart for the stuck robot to start at the insertion zone
  again. The other team can decide within 10 seconds to restart their
  involved robot in the insertion zone without it counting as a
  penalty restart.
\item Moving a workpiece of the opposing team at their MPS is a pushing
foul. The referee will move the workpiece back to its original position.
\item Intentional obstruction of the opposing team is a pushing foul, as
described in Section \ref{sec:obstruction-penalty}.
\item If a robot is restarted or called to maintenance, loses his
workpiece during collision avoidance or in case of a collision, the
workpiece will not be replaced and is removed by the referee.
\item The league reserves its right to disqualify clearly malicious
  teams.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Tournament}
\label{sec:tournament}
The tournament is organized in a main competition and three technical
challenges. Teams can decide to participate in any of those.

\subsection{Tournament Phases}
\label{sec:tournament-phases}
There will be three stages in the main competition, a round-robin
phase for all participating teams, playoffs for the best four teams
from the round-robin phase, and the finals. The best two teams of the
playoffs play the grand finale to decide which team will become the
next Logistics League champion, whereas the other two teams compete in
the small final for the third place.

\paragraph{Round-Robin phase.~}
The first stage is a group phase and will be played as a round-robin.
The teams will receive the true points they scored during the
competition. The points will be accumulated in this phase and the
teams will be ranked according to the accumulated points in descending
order.

\paragraph{Playoffs.~}
At the playoff stage, the scoring scheme will be different. As each
team in this phase directly competes with an opposing team, a ranking
score will be determined as follows. In each \emph{game}, the winning
team gets 3 ranking points, the loosing team gets 0. A team wins if it
achieves more points in the game than the other team
(cf. Sections~\ref{sec:exploration-phase} and
\ref{sec:production-phase}). In the case of a non-zero draw, see section \refsec{sec:overtime} for overtime.
If, after overtime, a draw is not
resolved, both teams get 1 ranking point. If both team end with a zero
score, each team gets 0 ranking points.
Points awarded for commentary are not considered in this decision.

The \emph{overall ranking} is determined by the ranking score of
teams, highest first. If two teams have the same score, the overall
total in-game points are summarized and the team with more game points
ranks higher. If there still is a draw, the direct comparison of the
games of the two teams is used to break the tie. If this still is
unsuccessful, a coin toss determines the higher ranked team.

\paragraph{Finals.~}
The best two teams of the playoff phase will advance to the grand
finale, the remaining two teams will compete in the small finals for
the third place. The team that scores more points after the regular
game time wins. If there is no winner after the regular time, refer to section \refsec{sec:overtime}. If after this there is still no
winner, a coin toss will decide.

\bigskip \hskip-\parindent
The detailed seeding will be created at the event. Although the idea
is to allow each participant to challenge each other team, the league
can be adjusted to meet time requirements.

\subsubsection{Overtime}
\label{sec:overtime}
Starting with the play-offs phase of the tournament the game must be
won by one of the teams by a higher score. If after the regular game
time there is a draw, the game will automatically and without
interruption be extended by 5 more minutes, unless both teams scored
zero points (points awarded for commentary are not considered in this
decision). If after five minutes there is still no winner, the team
scoring the first points during the extension will win.

\subsection{Game Commentary}
In addition to scoring in the exploration and the production phase,
points are also awarded if a team provides an commentary on
microphone to the public throughout the game as stated in \reftab{tab:scoring}. The commentary should
communicate the overall problems to be solved within this league, the
actual events taking place, but also give an insight on the own team
and how they solved certain tasks. It does neither have to be perfect,
nor to be a flawless stream of information. The commentary should be
continuous, but short pauses are acceptable. At the end of the game
the referees decide if the commentary duties were met. If both teams are willing to commentate
on the game, the game time is shared according to the team
specification (e.g., team 1 commentates the first half, team 2 the
second half). However, the teams can also make custom arrangements to
split the overall time.

\subsection{Penalties}
The catalog in \reftab{tab:infringements} represents the decision
basis for the referees not being exhaustive or binding.

\subsection{Technical Challenges}
\label{sec:technical-challenge}
Within the league, the technical advances should be documented from
year to year. Therefore, the Technical Challenge is introduced. Each
team should prepare for participating in any number of the following
tasks. However, participation has no influence on the normal game
results, but the winner will be awarded by a certificate.


\subsubsection{Markerless Machine Recognition and Production}
Currently, machines have markers that allows for recognizing their
respective types and relative position. The idea of this challenge is,
to remove the markers and still be able to recognize the type of a
machine and feed a base element onto the conveyor belt.

For this challenge, the markers will be removed or otherwise
hidden. Any sensor feedback is allowed to recognize the machine, but
no kind of markers or other indicators is allowed to be added to the
machine or the environment. The general idea is to test this as an
advancement of the league for future events. Distances between robots
and the machine are measured as the shortest distance from MPS trolley
to robot base on the ground. The maximum achievable score in this
challenge is 40 points -- up to 10 for the recognition and production
parts each, up to 10 for the explanation and methodologies, and up to
10 for the public release of the source code.

\vspace{-2ex}\paragraph{Recognition}
The refbox will randomly select four zones and machine types. The
machines are placed in the center of the respective zones. The robot
must approach the machines one after another and use only sensors
mounted on the robot to recognize the physical type of the
machine. The machines can be of any type. There is a time limit of 
\SI{2}{\minute} for the recognition task in which machines can be recognized.

The recognition part scores up to 20 points -- 5 points for each
machine. Of these 5 points, 2 points are awarded for proper approach
(robot standing at the input or output side of the machine facing
towards the machine with a distance of no more than \SI{0.5}{\metre})
and 3 points for correct recognition. The recognition must be provided
clearly visible on a screen or by text-to-speech output.

\vspace{-2ex}\paragraph{Production}
The refbox will randomly select a CS machine. The machine will be
pre-filled with a cap. The robot must then retrieve a base element
without cap from the shelf of the CS (at least one spot will be filled
with such a base element), feed it into the cap station, and retrieve
the finished product on the output side.

The production part scores up to 10 points. 3 points are awarded for a
proper approach (robot standing at the input or output side of the
machine facing towards the machine with a distance of no more than
\SI{0.25}{\metre}, note that the distance is shorter than for the
recognition part). Another 4 points are awarded for properly feeding
the base into the machine and the final 3 points are awarded for
successfully retrieving the finished product (moving with the product
to a minimum distance of \SI{0.5}{\metre} of the machine).

\vspace{-2ex}\paragraph{Explanation and Methodology}
%
The teams need to explain their used methods and techniques. The jury
of team leaders each gives scores from 0 (insufficient or no
explanation) to 10 (excellent explanation and useful methods). The
rounded up average of these points is added. Teams which have released
the source code to their approach on the web score up to 10
points. The jury again vote points depending on the documentation and
wealth of the implementation from 0 (no source code provided) to 10
(source code provided as readily usable package including all
necessary dependencies). If a package is only usable within a
non-disclosed software framework, the release cannot score more than
five points.


\subsubsection{Playing in Simulation}

The challenge is to play the production phase of an RCLL game, based
on the publicly released Gazebo-based simulation
\cite{llsf-sim-rc2014-2014}. The simulation
software\footnote{\url{https://www.fawkesrobotics.org/projects/rcll-sim/}}
including technical documentation is publicly available on
Github.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/robocup-logistics/gazebo-rcll}}

The simulation uses Gazebo and the exact same referee box to simulate
the environment reactions similar to the real game. We envision this
simulation to be a basis for a simulation RCLL sub-league to attract a
wider range of participants, but also to ease entering the robot
competition.

There is a new Planning Competition for Logistics Robots in
Simulation~\cite{LogRobComp2016} that is held at the International
Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS). The technical
challenge game will be played according to the same rules and
regulations of the ICAPS competition~\cite{LogRobComp-Rules-2017}. The
rules and regulations, and the reference USB stick image will be
available on the competition website April 1st
2017.\footnote{\url{http://www.robocup-logistics.org/sim-comp}} A
video tutorial is available at the same website.

\vspace{-2ex}\paragraph{The Game}
%
This challenge will be played following the rules of 2016, the most
notable difference is that there is no Storage Station. After a short
setup period of 60\,sec, the production phase will be started
immediately. The ground truth for the machine positions will be
provided.\footnote{This means that some of the major changes in 2017,
  regarding the Exploration Phase, are irrelevant for the simulation
  challenge. This is done to align closely with the ICAPS
  competition.} Please refer to the ICAPS competition manual for the
available interfaces.

\vspace{-2ex}\paragraph{Hardware Setup}
%
If feasible (and if the required hardware is available), we will use
the same infrastructure as is used in the ICAPS competiton. This may be a
Docker-based
infrastructure, virtual machines, or bare metal machines with a
standard image which may be extended. The exact setup will be
announced June 1st 2017 at the latest. Until then, the best option is
to prepare with the USB stick image provided on the competition
website.

\vspace{-2ex}\paragraph{Simulation Interfaces}
%
We will follow the ICAPS competition's setup and will provide two
principal interfaces: one based on Fawkes, and another based on
ROS. Please see the ICAPS competition's rules and regulations for the
details.

\vspace{-2ex}\paragraph{Robot Models and Plugins}
%
The simulation will be run with the standard set of models and plugins
of the Carologistics RoboCup team based on the 2016 source code
release.\footnote{\url{https://www.fawkesrobotics.org/p/rcll2016-release/}} No
custom Gazebo plugins or models may be loaded or used by the competing
teams. Since no physical simulation of workpiece handling is done and
the base regarding locomotion is the same, there should be no
issues for the teams to implement the flow of the game. However, teams must
make sure that the standard set of sensors
provided is sufficient.

\vspace{-2ex}\paragraph{Competition Area} The competition area can be
expected to be similar to Figure \ref{fig:competition-area}, however,
the MPS locations will be randomized as in the real game.

\vspace{-2ex}\paragraph{Abstraction Level} Teams need to utilize their
robot sensors to perceive the environment. There will be no available
ground truth published to the robots by the simulation software. That
is, robots need to localize and recognize the machines as well as
localize themselves via sensors attached to the robot.


\subsubsection{Open Challenge~}
Each team will be given 5 minutes to showcase their robot team, e.g.,
show some new robotics developments. This may involve any task as long
as it is performed with at most three Robotino robots within the
competition area. For the time of the free challenge, any software or
hardware modification is allowed, even though otherwise disallowed in
the regular competition. This may be used to motivate ideas for future
developments of the league and to highlight particular advances in the
system of the presenting team.

The team leaders of non-presenting team will judge the performance and
rate it with points between 0--10.  The team with the highest sum of
points will win this challenge. The other teams are ranked in
decreasing point order.

\subsubsection{Conducting the Challenges~}
The technical challenges are conducted in the following way. The team
leaders of each participating team agree on a date and time during the
tournament for the Technical Challenge in their first team leader
meeting. For each type of challenge, a time slot is assigned, in which
teams can participate once in the challenge. Each team can register
for any of the challenges. All team leaders have to be present at the
time of the challenge to judge the other teams. The OC is responsible
to conduct the Technical Challenge and can appoint team leaders as
support. Each challenge will have a separate ranking. In each ranking,
the team on the last rank will receive 0 points, the last-but-one
ranked team will receive 1 point etc. The points for each ranking will
be added and the team with the most points accrued over all challenges
will be awarded with the Logistic Leagues Technical Challenge Award.


\section{The Robotino System}
\label{sec:robotino}

All participants have to design their competition Robotinos within the
following specifications. For a detailed technical description of the
basic hardware, refer to the Appendix~\ref{sec:engref}. Robotino 2 is
still allowed, however, we strongly recommend using the Robotino 3 as
the robot hardware platform from this year on.

Any kind of sensors can be changed or added to	 the Robotino platform.
However, it is not possible to implement sensors that require
modifications outside the Robotino area (e.g., Northstar, indoor GPS).
There must be no changes to the controller or mechanical system.
The robots peripherals must not exceed the maximum total height of
\SI{1.1}{\metre} including the tower and the table on top. Additional
hardware (sensors, computing equipment, etc.)  must be within a circle
of a diameter of \SI{0.65}{\metre}  (for both, Robotino 2 and 3) or
centered at the robot's rotational center-point. Additional hardware
may only occupy up to $25\%$ of this additional \SI{0.14}{\metre}
(Robotino 2) or \SI{0.10}{\metre} (Robotino 3) wide ring around the
robot. The only additional actuator allowed is one gripping device for
workpieces which can be the original or a modified one. It also must
be within the same diameter of the other additional hardware. The
gripper is allowed to transport one workpiece at a time. And the
gripper must release the workpiece for safety whenever the referee
wants to take out it. For example, if the referee presses the release
button or key, the gripper releases the workpiece.

It is allowed to install additional computing power on the
\Robotino. This may either be in form of a notebook/laptop device or
any other computing device that suits the size requirement of the
\Robotino{} competition system. Furthermore, it is allowed to
communicate with an additional computing device off-field. This device
may be used for team coordination and/or other purposes. However,
communication among the robots and the off-field device is not
guaranteed during the competition.

\subsection{Markings}
\label{sec:robot-markings}
All field robots must be assigned a single unique number out of the
set $\{1, 2, 3\}$. The number must be written on the robot in one or
more places and clearly visible from all directions, e.g., printed
adhesive labels placed on top or the sides of the robot. The number
must be the same as is announced in the beacon signal to the referee
box (cf.~\refsec{sec:referee-box}).

For audiences and observers to distinguish both teams, all robots must
wear their respective unique colored label which is either cyan or
magenta.  The Velcro will be provided and is suggested to be placed on
the tower's side of each robot, the actual color-coded rings are then
dynamically divided among the playing teams.

\section{Communication}
\label{sec:communication}

Robots have to operate autonomously, that is, without any human
interference during the game. Communication among robots and to
off-board computing units is allowed only using wifi
(cf.~\refsec{sec:wifi-regulations}). Communication is not guaranteed
and may be unavailable during parts of the game. Interruptions must be
expected and are no reason to pause or abort a game, even if they
endure for long periods of the game.

\subsection{Bandwidth Allocation}
\label{sec:bandwidth}
No minimum bandwidth is guaranteed. The amount of communicated data
over the wifi connection shall not exceed
\SI[per-mode=symbol]{2}{\mega\bit\per\second}. Even though the lower
layers could provide for more bandwidth, the overall available
frequency spectrum and wifi channels have to be shared, not only
within our own league. Generally, a conservative use of bandwidth
resources is advised. Should a frequently or endured exceedance of the
bandwidth limit become known, or if the overall bandwidth limit must
be reduced due to outer circumstances, the TC can monitor the network
traffic and demand reduction in communicated data as necessary.

\subsection{Referee Box (refbox)}
\label{sec:referee-box}
The referee box (refbox) is a software system that runs on a system
provided by the Organizing Committee. It controls the overall game,
monitors feedback from the robots, and awards points. It is instructed
by an assisting human referee and keeps a log of all relevant game
events. The final game report will be produced by the referee
box. While we strive for a maximum of automation of this control task,
we rely on the human referee for final judgment, in particular for
border or under-specified cases, and will provide the largest set of
override abilities feasible.

The refbox is the single point of instruction for robots during the
game. After game setup has finished, game state information and orders
are announced by the refbox. Commands must be acknowledged. In certain
situations (for example during the exploration phase) for successful
and true communication with the refbox points are awarded. The aim is
to reduce human interference year by year to a minimum as to exhibit
the widest autonomy during the game possible. Ultimately, the refbox
should be able to fully control the game by itself, transforming all
participants, team members, and visitors alike into pure spectators of
the game, sometimes providing maintenance and crisis intervention when
necessary.

The communication from the refbox to the robot is a datagram-oriented
broadcast protocol based on Google protocol buffers\footnote{Available
  at \url{https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/}} (protobuf). The
protocol definition and technical parameters are described in detail
in the RoboCup Logistics League Referee Box Integrator's
Manual~\cite{RefBoxIntManual}

\subsection{Remote Control}
\label{sec:remote-control}
Remote operation or instruction of any kind of the robots is forbidden
at all times during a game. The only allowed interaction is for the
start-up (cf.~\refsec{sec:game-start}). Any failure to comply with
this rule will lead to immediate disqualification of the infringing
team.

\subsection{Monitoring}
\label{sec:monitoring}
\emph{Passive} monitoring, i.e., receive-only communication from a base
station of the robots' performance is allowed. However, the overall
bandwidth limit may not be exceeded.
%, this includes in particular, but
%is not limited to, images and other raw data.
If the referee has any reason to belief that a monitoring application
might be used for instruction, he can demand the shutdown of the
monitoring software (also refer to previous section on Remote
Control).

\subsection{Inter-robot Communication}
\label{sec:inter-robot-comm}
Robots currently active on the field can freely exchange any
information that supports a coordinated team play. Robots not actively
participating in the game, for example because they have been
irrevocably removed from the current game, may not communicate with
the other robots. It is forbidden to communicate with any sensors that
are not physically attached to the robot, including, for example, but
not limited to a camera aside the field. Likewise any off-robot
actuator is forbidden.

\subsection{Communication Eavesdropping and Interference}
\label{sec:comm-tampering}
% This might sound harsh, but it's based on lessons learned in
% numerous years of RoboCup, you wouldn't believe what some teams will
% do... :-/
Communication of another team may neither be eavesdropped on nor be
interfered with. Teams not currently active shall disconnect from the
field access points.

Monitoring of bandwidth used or of possible misbehavior may only be
performed by members of the TC or an appointed delegate.
% can add this, need to be clear that this must be done using a team
% leader majority vote and not just any team leader
% or by a person appointed by the team leaders.
Any indication of misbehavior will be discussed by the team leader
convention and may result in penalties or disqualification from the
tournament.


%Each robot has to operate autonomously. The communication between the
%robot and the device responsible for the Start/Stop command, as well
%as all communication amongst the robots has to be realized using the
%Wi-Fi connection. The program controlling the robot has to be executed
%locally by the robot itself. % It is strictly forbidden to use any kind
%% of external server acting as command point.
%\begin{rulechange}
%  The robots will receive their commands from the Referee-Box as
%  specified in the referee box protocol. Further, communication to one
%  dedicated off-board computing device is allowed. However, wifi
%  communication should not taken for granted during competition by the
%  participating teams.
%\end{rulechange}
%The robots are allowed to share information with other devices, but
%must receive nothing else but the start, pause and stop command
%from units other than the 2 fellow robots. This specifically excludes:
%Usage of processed image data created outside of the robots A central
%communication that requires a device other than the three Robotinos A
%permanently established connection between the command device and the
%Robotinos.

\subsection{Wifi Regulations}
\label{sec:wifi-regulations}
In order to provide the optimal possible solution for wireless
communication during the event, all teams are required to use the
\SI{5}{\giga\hertz} wifi equipment. They are furthermore required to
connect their Robotinos wifi unit to the access point provided. All
teams can also rely on wifi clients supplied by Festo but are not
required to. A detailed description concerning the infrastructure can
be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:wifi-equipment}.

% Please refer to Sect.~\ref{sec:radio-interference} for further details.

% \section{Development / Vision}

% This section is meant to enable discussions and support investment
% decisions for future soft- and hardware acquisitions.

% \subsection{Short term ideas}

% These are ideas that could still be incorporated into the rulebook of
% Istanbul 2011.

% \subsubsection{Scripted, dynamic obstacles}

% On the way to fully dynamic obstacles this iteration implies a fully
% scripted administration controlled Robotino that follows implicit
% movement rules that are known to all participants.

% \subsection{Midterm planning}
% Additions and alterations for future iterations of this competition


% \subsubsection{Various Production programs}
% A part from the three-staged production process, various goods with
% different work orders and specifications (e.g., top speed, delivery
% strategies...) could be part of the challenge. This addition seems to
% be heavily dependent on Sect.~\ref{sec:supp-flow}.

% \subsubsection{Various order strategies}
% A delivery could consist of more than one final product, it could be
% required to deliver a batch of products, maybe within a certain time
% span, to complete the loading and receive extra points. Also, the
% different delivery gates could obtain a predefined shipping list, for
% example gate 1 requiring 2 Products, 2 M2 and 1 M1, maybe in the
% correct order to enable FIFO, LIFO or other delivery strategies.

% \subsubsection{Simulation league}

% Since there is only the annually world championship and maybe a
% regional preregistration, a simulation platform could be provided,
% where the software framework of teams can be used to compete with
% other teams. Additionally a branch of simulation could be created that
% focuses on the simulation of many AGV and a huge production area in
% order to compete on scalability.

% \subsubsection{Introducing a supportive flow of information}
% \label{sec:supp-flow}

% As the current task only deals with the material stream, it is heavily
% limited to a simple static task. In order to enable a flow of
% information that transports complex orders, a combined effort should
% focus on implementing a data interface that can be used by all teams
% today and in the future. As this would be a giant leap towards the
% industrial application, a general discussion and a lot of effort has
% to be invested into this issue.


% \subsection{Long term Vision}
% Ideas, dreams and ideology that inspire the future development.

% \subsubsection{Complex production machines}
% As there are more ways to interact with a machine than mounting and
% dismounting a loading carrier, it is possible to develop new machine
% types that look different and are completely different to handle.

% \subsubsection{Collaborative Production}
% Teams could be required to cooperate with another team to enable a
% combined supply chain.

% \subsubsection{Opponent controlled dynamic obstacles}
% No scripted obstacle can truly represent challenges of the industrial
% application. In the long run, an opposing team has to be reinserted
% that is allowed and requested to anticipate the logistic processes in
% real time in order to create worst case scenarios for the teams.

% \subsubsection{Interfacing ERP / SCM}
% The interface used to present orders could be back ended with software
% from real business applications like ERP, PPS, WHM and SCM.

% \subsubsection{JIS / JIT implementation}
% With complex production processes and several other achievements and
% upgrades it could be useful to implement JIS and JIT tasks and
% procedures into the LL, requiring delivery strategies like LIFO, FIFO
% and certain time windows.

\section{Engineering Reference}
\label{sec:engref}
\subsection{The Mobile Robot System Robotino 3}
The mobile robot system Robotino is a platform with open mechanical
and electrical interfaces for the integration of additional devices
like sensors or motors. By default power is supplied via two
exchangeable \SI{12}{\volt} lead gel batteries which permit a running
time of up to two hours. Robotino is driven by 3 independent,
omni-directional drive units. They are mounted at an angle of
\ang{120} to each other. The three omni-directional drive units of
Robotino defines it as being holonomic, meaning that the controllable
degrees of freedom equals the total degrees of freedom of the
robot. The drive units are integrated in a sturdy, laser welded steel
chassis. The chassis is protected by a rubber bumper with integrated
switching sensor.

\label{fig:robotinos}
\end{figure}

\hskip-\parindent The motor speed will be controlled via a PID
controller implemented on a Atmel microprocessor of the controller
board of Robotino.

\subsubsection{Sensors}
Robotino is equipped with 9 vertical mounted infrared distance
measuring sensors which are mounted in the chassis at an angle of
\ang{40} to one another. Robotino can scrutinize all surrounding areas
for objects with these sensors.  Each of the sensors can be queried
individually via the controller board. Obstacles can thus be avoided,
clearances can be maintained and bearings can be taken on a selected
target. The sensors are capable of accurate or relative distance
measurements to objects at distances of \SI{4}{\centi\metre} to
\SI{30}{\centi\metre}. Sensor connection is especially simple
including just one analogue output signal and supply power. The
sensors' evaluation electronics determines distance and read it out as
an analogue signal.  The anti-collision sensor is comprised of a
switching strip which is secured around the entire circumference of
the chassis. A reliably recognizable signal is thus transmitted to the
controller unit.  Collisions with objects at any point on the housing
are detected and, for example, Robotino is brought to a
standstill. The inductive proximity sensor is supplied as an
additional component. It serves to detect metallic objects on the
floor.

The default webcam camera is plugged in via USB and is capable of full
HD 1080p video with auto light correction and two built in microphones
for stereo sound with noise-canceling.

%
%\subsubsection{Drive Unit}
%Each of the 3 drive units consists of the following components: DC
%Dunker motor with nominal speed of \SI{3600}{rpm} and nominal torque
%of \SI{3.8}{\newton\centi\metre}. Integrated planetary gear unit with
%a gear ratio of 4:1. Omni-directional wheels of diameter of
%\SI{80}{\milli\metre}. Toothed belt with gear wheels providing a
%transmission ratio of 4:1. Altogether this provides a gear
%transmission ratio of 16:1. Incremental encoder with a resolution of
%2048 increments per motor rotation. The motor and gear arrangement is
%shown in Figure~\ref{fig:driveunit}.
%
%The motor speed will be controlled via a PID controller implemented on
%a Atmel microprocessor of the controller board of Robotino.
%
%\subsubsection{Sensors}
%Robotino is equipped with 9 infrared distance measuring sensors which
%are mounted in the chassis at an angle of \ang{40} to one
%another. Robotino can scrutinize all surrounding areas for objects
%with these sensors.  Each of the sensors can be queried individually
%via the controller board. Obstacles can thus be avoided, clearances
%can be maintained and bearings can be taken on a selected target. The
%sensors are capable of accurate or relative distance measurements to
%objects at distances of \SI{4}{\centi\metre} to
%\SI{30}{\centi\metre}. Sensor connection is especially simple
%including just one analogue output signal and supply power. The
%sensors' evaluation electronics determines distance and read it out as
%an analogue signal.  The anti-collision sensor is comprised of a
%switching strip which is secured around the entire circumference of
%the chassis. A reliably recognizable signal is thus transmitted to the
%controller unit.  Collisions with objects at any point on the housing
%are detected and, for example, Robotino is brought to a
%standstill. The inductive proximity sensor is supplied as an
%additional component. It serves to detect metallic objects on the
%floor.
%
%The inductive proximity sensor must be attached to the mounting
%furnished for this purpose, and must be connected to the I/O
%interface.  The output voltage is \SI{0}{\volt} to \SI{10}{\volt}. The
%sensing range is \SI{0}{\milli\metre} to \SI{6}{\milli\metre}. Path
%tracking can also be implemented with the two included diffuse
%sensors.  Flexible fiber optic cables are connected to a fiber-optics
%unit which works with visible red light. Reflected light is
%detected. Different surfaces and colors produce different degrees of
%reflection. However, gradual differences in reflected light cannot be
%detected. The sensors must be attached to the mountings furnished for
%this purpose, and must be connected to the I/O interface.
%
%Robotino is equipped with a color webcam. The webcam is equipped with
%a USB interface. Also, there will be integrated a digital Gyroscope
%providing a high accuracy of the odometry in the virtual factory.

%
%The controller housing is connected to the wiring in the chassis via
%one plug-in. Thus you can easily take off the controller housing and
%you have direct access to the mechanical system. The controller system
%of Robotino is divided into two parts – an embedded PC and a
%micro-controller interface card: The Controller of Robotino consists of
%an embedded PC and a micro-controller interface board. The main
%controller is the embedded PC 104 plus controller with the 500 MHz
%processor AMD LX800. The PC has a SDRAM of 128 MB and is provided with
%a 1 GB flash card. There are numerous communication interfaces on
%board:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 2 $\times$ \SI[per-mode=symbol]{100}{\mega\bit\per\second} Ethernet
%\item 2 $\times$ external USB, 1 $\times$ on-board USB-connector
%\item 2 $\times$  RS232
%\item 1 $\times$ Parallel port and 1 $\times$ VGA port
%\item Wireless LAN Access Point following the standards 802.11/b/g.
%\item The access point can be switched into a client mode.  As an
%  option you may use WPA2-coding.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsubsection{Software}
%Pre-installed is an Ubuntu Linux operating system with real time kernel
%running on the embedded PC 104. The main part of the controller is the
%Robotino server, a real time Linux application. It controls the drive
%units and provides interfaces to communicate with external PC
%applications via wifi. There is an API with libraries which allow you
%to create applications for Robotino in numerous programming languages:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item C++ and C
%\item C\#
%\item .net and JAVA
%\item MatLab and Simulink
%\item Labview
%\end{itemize}
%
%\hskip-\parindent You may find a lot of examples concerning using the
%different API's in the public OpenRobotino forum at
%\url{http://www.openrobotino.org}.
%
%\paragraph{Robotino View}
%
%Robotino View is a graphical programming language with numerous
%prepared function blocks you can easily connect via input and output
%parameters to establish more complicated function diagrams. You can use
%these function diagrams as subprograms for more complex programming
%sequences. To build up general programming sequences Robotino View
%follows the international standard IEC 61131-3. You may run Robotino
%View on an external PC and Robotino View communicates directly with
%the Robotino Server on the PC 104 via wifi in order to control the
%robot system. The function blocks receive a direct feedback of the
%hardware components such that you can live interact with the robot
%system. On the other hand you can download Robotino View programs into
%the PC 104 in order to run the applications completely autonomously.
%There is a well defined interface to develop own function blocks in C++
%or Lua.
%
%\paragraph{Image Processing}
%
%Depending on the Robotino version it might happen that the standard web
%camera only provides image data by JPEG compression. This is very
%useful if you run your image processing on the PC and exchange the data
%via wifi. However, if you would like to run your image processing
%algorithms on the Robotino controller then the processor is not
%powerful enough in order to pack and to unpack the image data in a
%reasonable time. Thus we recommend for running image processing
%algorithms on the Robotino controller to use a camera without JPEG
%compression, e.g., use the low cost Logitech web camera C250.
